        <b>Q: How often is this app\'s data updated?</b> <br/>
        A: This app pulls all data from the Yugioh Wikia in real time, so the data is always up-to-date. <br/><br/>
        
        <b>Q: If the app\'s information is always up-to-date, why don\'t the latest changes in the Wikia show up in the app?</b> <br/>
        A: This app does some caching for performance reason, so you can force close and restart it to force it to load the latest data. <br/><br/>
        
        <b>Q: I like this app!</b> <br/>
        A: I\'m glad to hear it. Please rate it on the Play Store :) <br/><br/>
